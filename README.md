# A basic cms for blogs, ecommerce, and more in laravel.

I wanted to see if I could make a cms alternative to wordpress or druple for PHP programmers who like laravel.
The biggest thing I want to do with this is have bootstrap and not much else on the frontend. Maybe use alpineJS 
but even if it is a bit monolithic I still wanted this to be a tool for freelance PHP devs to use on small to mid
sized project.
